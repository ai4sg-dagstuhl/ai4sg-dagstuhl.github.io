title: Meet-up of the AI for Social Good community
---

Today we saw a dozen participants of the last AI for Social Good seminar get together to update each other on the projects that were started at the seminar last year. Some highlights! The Red Cross people are continuing the collaboration with UMass, while we heard from the Open Street Map folks that they have been working on an AI assisted mapping software - see Omran's blog post: https://www.hotosm.org/tech-blog/hot-tech-talks-fair/. They have / are trying a number of different models, including rampml https://rampml.global/. Mark your calendars: Omran will be giving a talk at the geospatial world forum in Rotterdam in May https://geospatialworldforum.org.
An Imperial Master's student has been working on the Airqo project and getting to grips with the data. Laterite has been working on Geospatial interpolation models with Ruby.
