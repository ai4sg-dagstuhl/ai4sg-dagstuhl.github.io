title: Confirmed: third AI for Social Good seminar in Dagstuhl in Feb 2024!
---
Great news for the AI for Social Good community: yesterday we (Claudia, Emti, Jacopo, and Ruben) received word from Dagstuhl that our proposal for a third AI for Social Good seminar has been accepted. Mark your calendars folks: AI experts and NGO representatives will convene from 18-23 February 2024 in the Dagstuhl castle to discuss how AI can benefit social good and to do some prototyping. Invitations will be sent out in the coming months.
